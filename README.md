# Linear Regression Assignment:
> BoomBikes a Bike Sharing service company aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
> The company wants to know:
> Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
> How well those variables describe the bike demands
> Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

## Business Goal:
> Build a Linear Regression Model to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary 
> with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for 
> management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
